# AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity Threat Detector

This project is a web-based dashboard for detecting and visualizing potential cybersecurity threats using AI models. The system is designed to process and analyze network traffic and system logs, using transformer-based models to identify anomalies and predict attacks before they occur.

The frontend is fully developed and deployed. The backend and AI model integration are currently under development. The UI is optimized for real-time monitoring and system status visualization.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Shadcn UI
- **State Management:** React (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Visualization:** (Planned) Chart.js or D3.js

### Backend (Planned)
- **Framework:** Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- **AI Models:** Transformer models (BERT, GPT via Hugging Face)
- **Libraries:** PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **Streaming:** Apache Kafka or WebSocket for real-time data
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Elasticsearch
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Features (Frontend)
- Dashboard for viewing threat alerts and system status
- Placeholder integration for AI-driven anomaly detection
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views
- Modular and scalable component structure using Shadcn UI
